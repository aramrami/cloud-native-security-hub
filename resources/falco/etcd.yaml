  # etcd Falco Rules

  A distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system

  ## Rules

  ### Unauthorized process opened an outbund connection

  Detects if an unauthorized process is trying to open an outbound connection

  Allowed processes:

  * etcd

  ### Unauthorized inbound tcp connection etcd

  Detects inbound network connections to etcd on unexpected ports

  Allowed inbound ports:

  * 2380
  * 4001
  * 7001

  ### Unexpected spawned process etcd

  Detects an unexpected process spawned in the etcd container

  Allowed processes:

  * /usr/local/bin/etcd

  ### Unexpected file read by etcd

  Detects an attempt to access a file readonly other than below an espected list of paths

  Allowed file prefixes for readonly:

  * /proc/self
  * /var/etcd/data/member

  ### Unexpected file readwrite by etcd

  Detects an attempt to access a file readonly other than below an expected list of paths

  Allowed file prefixes for readwrite:

  * /var/etcd/data/member

  ### Unexpected system calls in etcd container

  Detects an unexpected system call executed in etcd container

  Allowed system calls:

  * accept
  * openat
  * renameat
  * unlinkat

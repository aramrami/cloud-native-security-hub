  # CVE-2019-5736

  runC is the underlying container runtime beneath infrastructure such as Docker, CRI-O, containerd, Kubernetes and others. This new vulnerability allows a compromised container to overwrite the host runC binary and gain root-level execution and underlying file access. As a result, an attacker can run any root level command within a container when:
  * Spinning up a new container based on the attackerâ€™s image.
  * Attaching (docker exec) into an existing container which the attacker had previous write access to.
